# Iris

Iris is an Immediate mode GUI Library for Roblox, based on Dear ImGui. It is designed to make building debug, visualisation or content-creation tool UI easier, simpler and quicker.

Iris does this by requiring the developer to only describe what they want and not how they want it, whilst Iris handles all of the 'how'. This makes it quicker for developers to build a usable and powerful system with minimal code from them. Iris offers a range of versatile widgets which are all designed to be minimal and yet powerful and fit together perfectly.
