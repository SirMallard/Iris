# Iris
<!--moonwave-hide-before-this-line-->

Iris is an immediate-mode GUI Library for Roblox, based on [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). It solves the same problems as Dear ImGui: providing a simple and bloat-free UI system, designed for visualisation and debugging. It is fast, portable, and self-contained (no external dependencies).

## What is Dear ImGui, and why is it important?
Dear ImGui is best known for allowing developers to create content-creation and visualisation and debugging UI. Using the Dear ImGui paradigm (immediate-mode), UI design is remarkably simple and straightfoward. Because of this, Dear ImGui has been adopted in almost every major game engine, both commercial and proprietary.

Iris favors simplicity and productivity; it is designed to simplify UI, streamlining the process for creating visualisation, debug, and data input tools. To accomplish this, Iris offers a different approach to Roblox UI than existing libraries, providing a range of UI elements, whilst handling all inputs, placement and styling. This allows the focus to be on developing your project.

## Usage

Iris can be installed as a [package](https://wally.run/package/sirmallard/iris) using [Wally](https://wally.run/), as an rbxm file from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/SirMallard/Iris/releases/latest) or building from [source](https://github.com/SirMallard/Iris/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). You can import the rbxm into any roblox project, and begin creating UI in any client side script. No external dependences are needed. Iris can be used under any kind of Roblox UI, including PlayerGui, CoreGui, BillboardGui, SurfaceGui, and PluginGui.
